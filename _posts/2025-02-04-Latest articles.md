Well look here, it's been a bit. Turns out full time jobs keep you busy. Just a short post to share some things I've been doing and writings I've done elsewhere.

I did end up transitioning to embedded firmware development, first at Medtronic for 3 years, and then another year at Dojo Five, a small local consultancy company. I've gone to [Teardown](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2026), a great conference that I hope to go to again this year. I've also had some time volunteering with the local fixit clinics, fixing small household appliances and meeting some cool people there. 

I have some plans for more articles around using an oscilliscope, circuit analysis for FW engineers, getting into ADSB flight tracking, Lora and meshtastic, and more. 

While you wait, here's a couple Dojo Five Blog posts I wrote while I worked there:

[An Intro to Test Equipment Automation with VISA, SCPI, and the power of Python](https://dojofive.com/blog/test-equipment-automation/)

[An Overview of the quirks of NanoPB](https://dojofive.com/blog/nanopb-traps-and-how-to-avoid-them/)

[The Basics of going from bare metal to using the Nordic SDK Build system](https://dojofive.com/blog/transitioning-from-bare-metal-nordic-sdk-build-system/)
