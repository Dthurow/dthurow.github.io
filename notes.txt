Command to erase exif data from images in current directory:

~/Documents/CLI\ tools/Image-ExifTool-12.25/exiftool -EXIF= -tagsfromfile @ -exif:Orientation .

This keeps the orientation data but removes all the other bits

NOTE: This creates new copies with the same name, and re-labels the old one with _original at the end of the filename
