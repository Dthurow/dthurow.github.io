I graduated from Western Washington University March 2015 with a BS in CS and a minor in math, and have been moving closer to the hardware since. Started as a web developer and moved into embedded systems.  In my spare time, I play with infosec, reverse engineering, learning Japanese, and whatever else catches my fancy.
