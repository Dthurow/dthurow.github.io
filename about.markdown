Me at the Kennedy Space Center, with a very serious Wally Schirra (A member of the Mercury 7)
  


  



I graduated from Western Washington University March 2015 with a BS in CS and a minor in math. For the past 5 years I worked as a Senior Software Engineer, connecting up databases to the web, arguing over best long-term architectural decisions, and whatever else they needed me to do. Currently working as a freelance developer, living  in beautiful Minneapolis, MN.

In my spare time, I play with infosec, reverse engineering, learning Japanese, and whatever else catches my fancy.
